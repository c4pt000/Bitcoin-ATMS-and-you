# defeating the Bitcoin ATM
<p>
legacy cash ATM reciepts
these were jammed in the machine already.
<br>
this is what i specutlate it's not what i know...
<br>
my hacking attempt guess was simple because the machine had a pre existing hack from someone who eavesdropped on a technician entering a pin
<br>
when the person had the pin from eavesdropping they basically changed the pin to a simple default pin guess

my attempt today to print with the debug menu
