defeating the Bitcoin ATM

legacy cash ATM reciepts
these were jammed in the machine already.
this is what i specutlate it's not what i know...
my hacking attempt guess was simple because the machine had a pre existing hack from someone who eavesdropped on a technician entering a pin
when the person had the pin from eavesdropping they basically changed the pin to a simple default pin guess
